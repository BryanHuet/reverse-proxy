# Traefik Reverse Proxy with Personal Certificates

## Introduction

This project provides a simple setup for running a reverse proxy using Traefik, Docker, and personal SSL certificates. With Traefik, you can easily route incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to multiple Docker containers running different services on your server.

## Features

- **Reverse Proxy**: Route incoming requests to the appropriate Docker containers based on defined rules.
- **Automatic HTTPS**: Automatically obtain SSL certificates for your domains using Let's Encrypt (optional).
- **Custom Certificates**: Support for using your own SSL certificates for HTTPS encryption.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Easily update routing rules and configurations without restarting the reverse proxy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
- Personal SSL certificates for your domains.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your server:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd reverse-proxy
   ```

2. Place your SSL certificate (`cert.pem`) and private key (`key.pem`) files in the `certs` directory. The bash.sh file contains command lines to generate your keys but you have to create your own openssl.cnf

3. Customize the Traefik configuration in `traefik.yml` and `dynamic` directory according to your requirements.

4. Update your Docker services to include Traefik labels for routing. See [Traefik documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/) for label options.

5. Start the Traefik reverse proxy along with your Docker services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Verify that Traefik and your services are running correctly:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

## Usage

Once the reverse proxy is running, you can access your services via the defined domain names. Traefik will handle routing requests to the appropriate Docker containers based on your configuration.

## Configuration

- **Traefik Configuration**: Customize Traefik's behavior and settings in the `traefik.yml` file.
- **Routing Rules**: Define routing rules for your Docker services in the `dynamic` directory. Traefik will automatically detect changes and apply them.
